9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Setting Up and Starting Debugging
Example: Debugging a Simple JavaScript Program

    Open or Create a Project:
        Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project.
        Create a simple JavaScript file, app.js, with the following content:

        javascript

    function greet(name) {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }

    greet("World");

Initialize a Debug Configuration:

    Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
    Click on the gear icon (Configure or Fix launch.json) in the Debug view to create a launch.json file. This file contains debug configurations for your project.
    Select the environment you are working with, e.g., "Node.js" for JavaScript.
    VS Code will generate a launch.json file in the .vscode folder of your project. The file should look something like this:

    json

    {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "type": "node",
          "request": "launch",
          "name": "Launch Program",
          "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
          "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
      ]
    }

Set Breakpoints:

    Open app.js in the editor.
    Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set a breakpoint. For example, set a breakpoint on the line console.log(Hello, ${name}!);.

Start Debugging:

    Go to the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and click the green play button (Start Debugging) or press F5.
    The debugger will start and pause at the breakpoint you set.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

VS Code has built-in support for Git, which makes it easy to perform version control operations directly from the editor. Here’s how you can integrate Git with VS Code, initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.
Initializing a Git Repository

    Open Your Project:
        Open your project folder in VS Code.

    Initialize Git:
        Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
        Click the Initialize Repository button.
        VS Code will create a .git folder in your project directory, initializing the repository.

Making Commits

    Stage Changes:
        In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of files with changes.
        Click the + icon next to each file you want to stage, or click the + icon at the top of the Changes section to stage all changes.

    Enter a Commit Message:
        In the commit message box at the top of the Source Control view, type a descriptive commit message.

    Commit Changes:
        Click the checkmark icon to commit the staged changes.

Pushing Changes to GitHub

    Create a GitHub Repository:
        Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.
        Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git).

    Add Remote Repository:
        Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+`.
        Add the remote repository using the following command (replace the URL with your repository URL):


    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

Push Changes:
